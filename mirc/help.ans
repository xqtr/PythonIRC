remote versioning and may not return a version string. If you provide a 
wildcard string, the first server which matches will be shown.

|11/PING [server]

operator (@) otherwise.

|03Looks up the information of users matching the range you provide. You may only

|03them, or ones which are not +i (unless you are an IRC operator). The 
search-pattern may be a special sequence of characters determined by the flags 
given below, or it may be one of a nickname, a channel, a hostmask, an ip
address mask or a server mask.

|10WHO flags
|03The following flags after the mask have the following affects:
o |00        |03Show online IRC operators matching the mask
u |00        |03Unlimit the results past the maximum /who results value (IRC operator
 only)
r |00        |03Show all users whos realnames match the mask. When this flag is set i
 overrides the meaning of the search-pattern, which must contain a glob pattern
intended to match GECOS (realname) fields.
h |00        |03Show real hostnames rather than masked hostnames (IRC operators only)
m |00        |03Search for all users with a given set of user modes. When this flag i
 set it overrides the meaning of the search-pattern, which must contain the mod
 sequence to search for, for example to find all users with +i and without +s, 
ssue the command WHO +i-s m.
a |00        |03Show all users who's away message matches the given mask
p |00        |03Show all users who are connected on the given port range

You may combine multiple flags in one WHO command except where stated in the 
table above.
|10Examples

|11/WHO +ix-s ml
|03Show all users whos GECOS matches 'hiding*person' who are not on the local serv
r

80.
|11/WHO 6660-6668,6679,6680 p

such as /NICK and /USER on ports designated for server connections.

|11/WALLOPS [message]
|03Sends a message to all users who have usermode +w set.

|11/KLINE [user@host] {[duration] :[reason]}
|03Sets or removes a k-line (host based ban) on a host and ident mask. You must
specify at least 3 parameters to add a ban, and one parameter to remove a ban
(just the user@host section). The duration may be specified in seconds, or in
the following format 1y2w3d4h5m6s - meaning one year, two weeks, three days, 4 
hours, 5 minutes and 6 seconds. All fields in this format are optional.

Please note that KLINE is checked before the user registers in a similar way to
ZLINE if it is a '*@ip' format of mask. This prevents waste of resources in
needless DNS and ident lookups etc.

|11/ZLINE [ipmask] {[duration] :[reason]}
|03Sets or removes a z-line (ip based ban) on an ip range mask. You must specify 
at least 3 parameters to add a ban, and one parameter to remove a ban (just the
ipmask). The duration may be specified in seconds, or in the following format 
1y2w3d4h5m6s - meaning one year, two weeks, three days, 4 hours, 5 minutes and 
6 seconds. All fields in this format are optional.

|11/QLINE [nickmask] {[duration] :[reason]}
|03Sets or removes a q-line (global nick based ban) on a nick mask. You must 
specify at least 3 parameters to add a ban, and one parameter to remove a ban 
(just the nickmask). The duration may be specified in seconds, or in the 
following format 1y2w3d4h5m6s - meaning one year, two weeks, three days, 4 
hours, 5 minutes and 6 seconds. All fields in this format are optional.

|11/GLINE [user@host] {[duration] :[reason]}
|03Sets or removes a g-line (global host based ban) on host mask. You must specify
at least 3 parameters to add a ban, and one parameter to remove a ban (just 
the user@host section). The duration may be specified in seconds, or in the 
following format 1y2w3d4h5m6s - meaning one year, two weeks, three days, 4
 hours, 5 minutes and 6 seconds. All fields in this format are optional.

Please note that GLINE is checked before the user registers in a similar way to
ZLINE if it is a '*@ip' format of mask. This prevents waste of resources in
needless DNS and ident lookups etc.

|11/ELINE [user@host] {[duration] :[reason]}
|03Sets or removes a e-line (local ban exception) on host mask. You must specify 
at least 3 parameters to add an exception, and one parameter to remove an 
exception (just the user@host section). The duration may be specified in 
seconds, or in the following format 1y2w3d4h5m6s - meaning one year, two weeks,
three days, 4 hours, 5 minutes and 6 seconds. All fields in this format are 
optional.

|11/DIE [password]
|03If the correct password is provided, and you are an operator, this command will
shut down the local server.

|11/RESTART [password]
|03If the correct password is provided, and you are an operator, this command will
restart the local server.

|11/KILL [nickname-list] [reason]
|03This command will disconnect a user from IRC with the given reason. You may 
provide the nicknames of multiple users in the first parameter seperated by 
commas. If you disconnect yourself, parsing of the command will stop at the 
position of your nickname in the list.

|11/REHASH {servername}
|03This command will cause the server configuration file to be re-read and values 
re-initialised. All modules which are able will reload their settings and 
re-initialize. The core will also unload any modules which you have removed 
from the config, and load any new modules which you have added since the 
last time the Configuration file was read. If a server name is provided, the 
remote server given is rehashed instead of the local one.

Unlike many other ircd programs, REHASH commands continue along their path 
after being actioned upon, so for example "/REHASH *" will rehash all servers 
on the network including the local one.

|11/TRACE [nick|user@host|servermask]
|03This command will provide a list of all users and servers which must be passed 
through or over to reach a given object (server or user)

|11/CONNECT [servermask] {servermask}
|03Create a connection to the given servermask. You must have configured the 
server for linking in your configuration file, and provided a password. If you 
specify more than one parameter, the first parameter is that of a server to be 
instructed to connect to the second, remotely.

|11/SQUIT [servermask]
|03Disconnect a locally connected server matching servermask from the network.

|11/RSQUIT [servermask]
|03This causes a remote server, specified by the servermask, to disconnect from 
the network without desyncing the network.
